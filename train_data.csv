In determining the amounts which the respective parties shall contribute, there shall be considered the relative benefits received by each party from the offering of the Registrable Securities (taking into account the portion of the proceeds of the offering realized by each), the parties' relative knowledge and access to information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission and any other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. The Company and each Holder selling securities agree with each other that no seller of Registrable Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount such seller would have been required to pay to an indemnified party if the indemnity under Section 2.5(b) were available. The Company and each such seller agree with each other and the underwriters of the Registrable Securities, if requested by such underwriters, that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation (even if the underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or for the underwriters' portion of such contribution to exceed the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the initial public offering price of the Registrable Securities.

The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Investors, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of the Units (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total compensation received by the Underwriters (before deducting expenses) from the sale of Units on behalf of the Company. If, but only if, the allocation provided by the foregoing sentence is not permitted by applicable law, the allocation of contribution shall be made in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in the foregoing sentence but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, with respect to the statements or omission that resulted in such loss, claim, liability, expense or damage, or action in respect thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations with respect to such offering. Such relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
